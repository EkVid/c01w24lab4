In the frontend, the array storing the notes would be updated before
  getting deleted from the database, so the note disappears yet it
  wasn't deleted from the database. Thus refreshing will cause the note
  to reappear after clicking delete.

In the backend, there is only a console.log before sending a 500 response,
  so there wasn't any attempt to delete the note.
